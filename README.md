# A test-driven JS assessment

This repo includes a set of tests that can be used to assess the skills of
a candidate for a JavaScript position, or to improve one's own skills.

The original repo is [here](https://github.com/rmurphey/js-assessment). This is my Fork where I solved all the test. I solved them first by using my own knowledge of JS, secondly by referencing [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript), and a very few times when really stumped I looked for help on StackOverflow. I commented on my solutions pointing twoard the resources I used to solve the test. 

All test are passing now! For the most part all of them are the correct solution, although I think I could refactor some of the functional programming test.
